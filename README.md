Raspberry Pi bootstrap resources. Designed for my own use, but hey, 
maybe someone else will find this marginally useful.

Default scripts are for Raspbian. I don't really like Arch, though
it does boot faster. I just started down that road to attempt a 
solution to a nasty segfault I was getting (it didn't help).

The goal of all this is to get a humane CLI/Python environment configured.

Just don't give my public key root :-)
